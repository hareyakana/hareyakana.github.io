Research project that was never made public. 

I could have work on it alone and get it release it on Arxiv but due to the nature of the data used in the studies, I needed the permission of various people that was uncoorperative. 

Now I am just going to leave my ideas, efforts and results here so that people might know that I have actually worked on it.

Most of the work here are incomplete or represent the early stages of project. The files are hosted on my personal github.
