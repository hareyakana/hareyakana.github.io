About myself
======
 Born in 1993 and raised in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia till the age of 18 where I then pursued my undergraduate studies in Southampton, UK for 4 years. After that, I moved to Osaka, Japan for post-graduate studies. Currently residing in Japan.

 I am mostly working independently by myself for my thesis(I am saying this as getting feedback about my work is difficult from the people that I worked with). Therefore I am using my blog as a channel to share my research work and also a channel to vent my frustration during this PhD process of mine.
