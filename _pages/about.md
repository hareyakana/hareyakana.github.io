About myself
======
 Born in 1993 and raised in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia until the age of 18. Pursued undergraduate studies at University of Southampton, UK for 4 years. Moved to Japan for post-graduate studies at Osaka University under 3 years MEXT(文部科学省) scholarship grant from the Japanese government.

 I am a Ph.D student where I work independently most of the time. Time to time I share and coordinate research work with other people. Due to some trouble with completing my Ph.D. due to financial trouble, I am currently actively job hunting to support myself. Please feel free to Skype or call me directly as I am open to new adventures for the next phase of my life.

 I maintain a blog on this website as a means to share my thoughts where I do vent some of my frustration as it is not convenient to share on social media or in person.
