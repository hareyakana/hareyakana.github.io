Current Phd student at Department of Physics, Graduate School of Science, Osaka University, Japan. Currently working on developing bolometer prototype for neutrinoless double beta decay experiment. I am also interested in using machine learning techniques for experimental physics data analysis to learn hidden data structure and signal background classification.
