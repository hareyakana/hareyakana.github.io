You may have probably heard of black company in Japan through mainstream news media where cases of people dying due to overwork. Today I want to bring your attention to darker side of academia in Japanese University that is unknown to the Western world. Black Laboratory aka. ブラック研究室(Burakku kenkyuu shitsu). I am writing this from a perspective of a foreign student in such research group.

Black Laboratory

In Japan, if one student decides to pursue a Ph.D. in graduate school, It typical takes about 3 years regardless of field with the exception to medical school. Although there are cases where student takes an extra year or two of extension student to complete their Ph.D. program though such cases are uncommon but it happens. Typically student choose a research group under the supervision of a mentor which are normally professors with the end goal of achieving a unique research thesis at the end of the 3 years. Student also usually are hired as research assistant or teaching assistant while completing their thesis. In half of the cases, student are also funded through scholarship where the living expenses are covered so student can focus on completing the thesis.
